     * The most notable change that everyone talks about is lambda functions
     * with java 8. A lambda function is just syntactic sugar for anonymous
     * classes that only need one method to be implemented.
     *
     * The anonymous class can now be represented with an arrow like so:
     * () -> [do something]
     *
     * If you have a method with no args, you will still need to use parenthesis'
     * to represent that there is no input to the function. A function takes input
     * and transform it to output, that is what the arrow symbolizes; "Input will
     * be transformed with the following."
     *
     * <p>
     * For this test, we will be working with MyFirstFunction which is defined
     * for us in #{@link util.LessonResources.MyFirstFunction}, it is a simple
     * interface with one method
     * </p>

     * contain our variables that we would normally define when we
     * define our method. Just like previously, we will use another
     * one line lambda expression. When using a one line expression,
     * there is an implicit return, so unlike with the anonymous class,
     * we do not have to write the explicit return statement.
