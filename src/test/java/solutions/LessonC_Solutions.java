    /**
     * A new operator has also been introduces in java 8; '::'
     *
     * Venkat Subramaniam said it best, in a talk he gave, by
     * calling it the pass through operator. The way he described
     * it was to think of it as a way to short hand passing the input
     * through to the function you want to call.
     *
     * By itself this is not that powerful, but in the next lesson,
     * we will get into streams and chaining actions and this operator
     * will show its true strength.
     *
     * In this test we will convert the comparator implementation
     * with to use the :: operator. Our comparator and the
     * default sort will have the same results, we are just
     * demonstrating a simple example.
