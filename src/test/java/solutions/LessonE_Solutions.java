     * java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar have not been replaced, but a new
     * package (java.time.*) has been introduced to give us more precise classes
     * when programming with dates and times.
     *
     * First, let's look at dates. Do you care about both the date and the time
     * (like a blog posted 3 minutes ago)?  Or do you only care about the date
     * (like how taxes are due at the end of a day) or just the time (like a
     * repeating appointment at 11:00am)?  There are now different classes to
     * represent each of these concepts.
     *
     * The biggest change is that the new classes are immutable!
     *
     * This test will compare the calendar API to the LocalTime and LocalDate
     * API. There is a LocalDate.now() method but that makes writing
     * tests for this koan a lot harder to code for.
