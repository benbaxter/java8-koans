     * java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar have not been replaced
     * but a new package (java.time.*) has been introduced to give
     * us a better handle when it comes to programming for time.
     *
     * There are multiple concepts when it comes to dates, but let's
     * start with creating dates. When approaching dates and times,
     * you will want to be explicit. Do you care about the time of
     * day (like a blog posted 3 minutes ago) or do you care about
     * the day in general (like how taxes are due at the end of a day)
     *
     * The biggest change to note is that dates are now immutable!
     *
     * This test will compare the calendar api to the LocalTime and LocalDate
     * api. There is a LocalDate.now() method but that makes writing
     * tests for this koan a lot harder to code for.
