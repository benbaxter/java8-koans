    /**
     * A concept that has been in many languages, such as Scala
     * and libraries like Google's Guava, is Option, or {@link Optional}.
     * The idea is to be more explicit about whether a value can be null or not,
     * so as to prevent NullPointerExceptions. Instead of getting the object you
     * want, you get an interface that wraps an object. The interface has two
     * main methods, isPresent() and get(). isPresent() is equivalent to testing
     * if the object is null or not. The get() call will actually return the
     * object underneath the Optional.
     *
     * This Optional concept has be integrated into the stream API. When
     * searching for specific items in a stream, they will be wrapped in an
     * Optional, because it's possible that no matches will be found.
     *
     * Sometimes we have a list of items and want to find only one particular
     * item. In previous versions of Java, this would consist of setting up a
     * for loop, then instantly constructing an if statement for 'filtering'
     * for the particular object we are looking for. Before the for loop, we would
     * setup a placeholder variable that we would assign a value to from inside
     * the for loop. (Code smell: side effects) There is a possibility that this
     * variable could be null, forcing us to have a null check after the for loop
     * if we remember to add it. With streams, we can combine operations, Optionals,
     * and the findFirst/findAny operators to 'safely' perform the same actions.
     *
     * In this test we will combine all of our learnings so far. We will
     * use the same menu from the previous test, it has just been abstracted
     * into the {@link LessonResources} class. You will need to know the prices
     * of certain foods in order to pass the test. Feel free to read the source
     * code of the LessonResources class to discover the prices used or review the
